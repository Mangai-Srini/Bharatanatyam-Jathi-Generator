# Bharatanatyam-Jathi-Generator
Bharatanatyam Jathi Generator â€“ A Streamlit app that generates rhythmic jathis using AI, Markov chains, and music processing.  A tool to automatically generate Bharatanatyam jathis from Carnatic music inputs, leveraging Markov models, rhythm analysis, and deep learning. Built with Streamlit, Torch, and PrettyMIDI.

A Streamlit-based AI tool to generate **Bharatanatyam jathis** from Carnatic music inputs.  
This project combines **Markov models, optimization, and deep learning** to create rhythmic sequences aligned with Carnatic talas.
